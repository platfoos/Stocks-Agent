# Daily US Stock Scanner Results

No setups above 85 today.

Likely causes: insufficient volume-confirmed breakouts, relative strength below threshold, or earnings within 14 days.
Potential relaxations: allow breakout-without-volume if trend is very strong, reduce minimum score to 80, or allow wider SL up to 6-7% while keeping >=1.5 ATR.
